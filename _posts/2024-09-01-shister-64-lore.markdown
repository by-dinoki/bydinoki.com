One more thing, he doesn't like (or maybe hates) being dirty, so he takes a shower before going to sleep, it makes him feel comfortable (especially on summer days), and he falls asleep as if he were in the clouds (well, if nothing bad happened to him). He has some problems with his life, one of them is about a person who was using him for things that Shíster didn't want to do and feeling limited because of that person, also about a condition that he "suffers from" but I don't want to mention that here, and that in the past I had an addiction that I don't want to say here either. His classmates are different from him since the classmates in his class practice sports and boxing, and he alone did very good arts and crafts for people. And he when someone pats him behaves like a cat, idk why he haves this behavior when they caress him. Shíster goes to the bathroom to see himself (and maybe suggest himself about his body) just to vent and get rid of the anger he has inside him.
